c. After measuring performance for all models trained, I decided to stick with the Random Forest Classifier. A random forest model always leaves space for improvement, and I am absolutely sure that my solution can be improved even more, via various fine tune methods.

d. A great source of information that covers a large part of Machine Learning is the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron. It strengthened my knowledge about ML, even though I am still in course of reading it. Other useful tutorials were found on YouTube, the majority of them from Tech with Tim channel.
